# InterviewBit

This repository consists of different programs which are solutions to different algorithm and data structure problems, given in InterviewBit. These problems are stored in their respective folders and their titles are the sections, mentioned on the site.

Folder 1: Arrays

    Code 1: Largest number (converting the integers into strings and comparing them)
    
Folder 2: Backtracking

    Code 1: All possible combinations of k numbers from n numbers

Folder 3: Bit Manipulation

    Code 1: Count number of 1 bits
    
    Code 2: Calculate the value of reversed bits

Folder 4: Hashing

    Code 1: Anagrams in a given list of strings
    
    Code 2: Find if a number is COLORFUL or not using dynamic programming
    
    Code 3: Sum of two numbers, equals to a target value

Folder 5: Linked List

    Code 1: Add to numbers represented as linked lists

    Code 2: Remove all the duplicate elements in the given linked list

    Code 3: Detect the starting point of a cycle, if it exists, in a given linked list

    Code 4: Merge two sorted linked lists

    Code 5: Given a linked list, rotate it k steps towards right
    
Folder 6: Math

    Code 1: FizzBuzz code (i.e for multiples of 3-->Fizz, for multiples of 5-->Buzz, for multiples of 3 and 5-->FizzBuzz)

Folder 7: Two Pointers

    Code 1 : Maximum area of water that can be contained in the containers (using two pointers, one from the left, another from the right)
